## Overview

Pjax is a technique that combines Ajax and `history.pushState` to speed up page
transitions on classic multi-page websites.

It lets you combine server-side rendering and routing with fast clientside
navigation.

Open your browser's network console and observe it while navigating the site.
This site is very lightweight, so the effects won't seem dramatic. However, for
large, content-heavy websites the speedup can be cataclysmic.

This is a fully functional library that doesn't require configuration. Try it on your website!
